# The project: Build a Food Review website 🌮🥑
As a team we were tasked to build a food review website that lists several Brunch restaurants in the Seattle, WA, area. 
It was to be completed over two days and demoed to a smaller group within the bootcamp. Furthermore the project was expected to 
help us practice our JavaScript and API fetching skills and for us to experience working together as a team 💪

# As a team we were asked to achieve the following:
1. Fetch the restaurants name, address, the image that the restaurant supplies, average rating and average price
for a meal at each restaurant from the 🍅 Zomato API https://developers.zomato.com/. 
2. Sort the restaurants based on the rating from highest to lowest.
3. In terms of layout and design we were given the choice to follow the Deliveroo food ordering service website 
template.
4. Make the site responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. 
5. Work together using branches and merging these to the master.

# How we approached the project
1. We first came up with a plan of what we needed to achieve.
2. We then created some of the basic HTML structure and created te main fetch() from the 🍅 Zomato API based on the requirements. 
3. The we divided up into smaller teams where one focused on creating the javascript elements and the other on the CSS aspects. We created sepereate branches to work in.
4. We had constant contact with one another incase we needed to ask questions. 
5. On day two we had a stand up where we went over what we achieved since the day before, what we had left to do in our
respective teams and what we needed help with from the others in the team.
6. Before the demo we needed to make sure that the two brances, api and styling , were in sync with one another and that
conflicts could be fixed before merging with the main repo.

# Resources we used
1. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2. Google. 
3. Teachers and one another.
